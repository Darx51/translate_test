  <h1>My Web Page</h1>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
  Get along with the voices inside of my head
  You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
  And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
  I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
  Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
  Wanted to receive attention for my music
  Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me
  Been wanting my cake, I need it too, wanting it both ways
  Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
  When I blew seep it was confusing
  'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
  Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
  Ooh, hit the lottery, oh wee
  With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
  It was like winning a huge meet
  Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
  I'm beginning to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
  Going cucko and cuckier as Kool Keith
  But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
  I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
  Get along with the voices inside of my head
  You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
  And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
  Well, that's nothing
  Well, that's nothing
  Now I ain't much of a poet, but I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
  And don't squander it, 'cause you never know when it could all be over
  Tomorrow so I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
  (Yeah, ponder it, Do you wonder there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way
  You're brought up?)
  I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled upon Jeff VanVonderen
  'Cause I needed an intervention in this to intervene between me and this monster
  And save me from myself and all this conflict
  'Cause the very things that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
  My OCD is conking me in the head
  Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
  I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying
  Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
  I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
  Get along with the voices inside of my head
  You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
  And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
  Well, that's nothing
  Well, that's nothing
  Call me crazy, but I had this vision
  One day that I'd walk amongst you regular civilians
  But until then drums get killed I'm coming straight at
  MCs, blood get spilled and I take it back
  To the days that I get on a Dre track
  Give every kid who got played at
  Pumped the villian and shit that say back
  To the kids who played 'em
  I ain't here to save the fucking children
  But if one kid out of a hundred million
  Who are going through a struggle feels and relates that's great
  It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
  In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
  Straw in the gold chump I will spend Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack
  Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
  I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
  It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
  I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
  Get along with the voices inside of my head
  You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
  And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
  I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
  Get along with the voices inside of my head
  You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
  And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
  Well, that's nothing
  Well, that's nothing


  Look
  If you had
  One shot
  Or one opportunity
  To seize everything you ever wanted
  In one moment
  Would you capture it?
  Or just let it slip?
  Yo
  His palms are sweaty
  Knees weak, arms are heavy
  There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
  He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
  To drop bombs
  But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
  The whole crowd goes so loud
  He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
  He's choking how, everybody's joking now
  The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
  Snap back to reality
  Oh, there goes gravity
  Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
  He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
  He won't have it, he knows
  His whole back's to these ropes
  It don't matter, he's dope
  He knows that, but he's broke
  He's so stagnant, he knows
  When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
  Back to the lab again, yo
  This whole rhapsody
  Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
  You better
  Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
  You better never let it go
  You only get one shot
  Do not miss your chance to blow
  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
  You better
  Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
  You better never let it go
  You only get one shot
  Do not miss your chance to blow
  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo (You better)
  The soul's escaping
  Through this hole that is gaping
  This world is mine for the taking
  Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
  A normal life is boring
  But superstardom's close to post mortem
  It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
  He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
  Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
  Lonely roads, God only knows he's grown farther
  From home, he's known father
  He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
  But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
  These h- don't want him no more, he's cold product
  They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
  He nose dove and sold nada
  So the soap opera is told and unfolds
  I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on
  Da da dum, da dum da da da da
  You better
  Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
  You better never let it go
  You only get one shot
  Do not miss your chance to blow
  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
  You better
  Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
  You better never let it go (go)
  You only get one shot
  Do not miss your chance to blow
  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo (you better)
  No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
  Tear this motherf- roof off like two dogs caged
  I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
  I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
  But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
  Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
  All the pain inside amplified by the
  Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
  Five and I can't provide the right type of
  Life for my family
  'Cause man, these g- food stamps don't buy diapers
  And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
  And these times are so hard
  And it's getting even harder trying to feed and water my seed plus
  Teeter totter, caught up between being a father and a prima donna
  Baby mama drama's screaming on her, too much
  For me to wanna stay in one spot
  Another day of monotony has gotten me
  To the point, I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
  Or end up in jail or shot
  Success is my only motherf- option
  Failure's not
  Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
  I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
  So here I go it's my shot
  Feet, fail me not
  This may be the only opportunity that I got
  You better
  Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
  You better never let it go (go)
  You only get one shot
  Do not miss your chance to blow
  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
  You better
  Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
  You better never let it go (go)
  You only get one shot
  Do not miss your chance to blow
  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo (you better)
  You can do anything you set your mind to, man

<br>
<p>
  Yeah
  I know sometimes things may not
  Always make sense to you right now
  But hey, what daddy always tell you?
  Straighten up little soldier
  Stiffen up that upper lip
  What you crying about?
  You got me
  Hailie, I know you miss your mom
  And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
  But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
  I can see you're sad
  Even when you smile
  Even when you laugh
  I can see it in your eyes
  Deep inside, you wanna cry
  'Cause you're scared
  I ain't there?
  Daddy's with you in your prayers
  No more crying
  Wipe them tears
  Daddy's here
  No more nightmares
  We gonna pull together through it
  We gon' do it
  Lainie, uncle's crazy ain't he?
  Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
  We're all we got in this world
  When it spins
  When it swirls
  When it whirls
  When it twirls
  Two little beautiful girls
  Looking puzzled, in a daze
  I know it's confusing you
  Daddy's always on the move
  Mama's always on the news
  I try to keep you sheltered from it
  But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
  The more it backfires on me
  All the things, growing up
  As daddy that he had to see
  Daddy don't want you to see
  But you see just as much as he did
  We did not plan it to be this way
  Your mother and me
  But things have got so bad between us
  I don't see us ever being together ever again
  Like we used to be when was teenagers
  But then of course
  Everything always happens for a reason
  I guess it was never meant to be
  But it's just something
  We have no control over
  And that's what destiny is
  But no more worries
  Rest your head and go to sleep
  Maybe one day we'll wake up
  And this will all just be a dream
  Now hush little baby don't you cry
  Everything's gonna be alright
  Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
  I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya
  Through the night
  I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
  We fear how we feel inside
  It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
  But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright
  It's funny
  I remember back one year when daddy had no money
  Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
  And stuck 'em under the tree
  And said some of them were from me
  'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
  I'll never forget that Christmas
  I sat up the whole night cryin'
  'Cause daddy felt like a bum
  See daddy had a job
  But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
  And at the time, every house that we lived in
  Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
  And your mom, was saving money
  For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you
  So you can go to college
  Almost had a thousand dollars
  'Til someone broke in and stole it
  And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
  And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
  Mom and dad was arguing a lot
  So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat
  One bedroom apartment
  And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra
  And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
  And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me
  But daddy had to work
  You and mama had to leave me
  Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
  And mama didn't like it
  And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
  Papa was a rolling stone
  Mama developed a habit
  And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
  I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
  'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
  Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'
  Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
  To see how much you both have grown
  It's almost like your sisters now
  Wow, I guess you pretty much are
  And daddy's still here
  Lainie I'm talking to you too
  Daddy's still here
  I like the sound of that, yeah
  It's got a ring to it, don't it?
  Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment
  Now hush little baby don't you cry
  Everything's gonna be alright
  Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
  I told ya daddy's here to hold ya
  Through the night
  I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
  We fear how we feel inside
  It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
  But I promise
  Mama's gonna be alright
  And if you ask me to
  Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
  I'ma give you the world
  I'ma buy a diamond ring for you
  I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
  And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
  I'ma break that birdy's neck
  I'll go back to the jeweller who sold it to ya
  And make him eat every carat
  Don't fuck with dad, haha
